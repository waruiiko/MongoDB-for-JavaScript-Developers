# Introduction and Setup
## MongoDB URI

## Setting Up Atlas

## OVERVIEW
Overview
We are going to have series of README instructions to be able to setup our MFLIX application successfully. With MFLIX application, you will learn to create and share a database connection, perform the basic Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations through the driver, handle errors, utilize the MongoDB best practices and more.

Mflix is composed of two main components:

Frontend: All the UI functionality is already implemented for you, which includes the built-in React application that you do not need to worry about.
Backend: The project that provides the necessary service to the application. The code flow is already implemented except some functions.
You'll only be implementing the functions which directly call to MongoDB.

Database Layer
We will be using MongoDB Atlas, MongoDB's official Database as a Service (DBaaS), so you will not need to manage the database component yourself. However, you will still need to install MongoDB locally to access the command line tools that interact with Atlas, to load data into MongoDB and potentially do some exploration of your database with the shell.

The following README sections are here to get you setup for this course.
